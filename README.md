## What I learned
- Using of useeffect hook to fetch data using routers
- Using hash router to duplicate dummy data to avoid paying for  request
- Master the step-by- step process to create an application
- How to deploy an app

## Difficulties
- require API KEY
- do not allow free request from browser only for development.


## deployment link

https://georgetteolinga.github.io/REACT_Project_newsapi/

I did not realize it until deployment, but this news API does not allow free requests from the browser. They only allow free requests from localhost. So in deployment I am using dummy data.
